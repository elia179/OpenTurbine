//  PowerTurbineGovernor — N2 speed-hold for turboshaft / APU
//
//  In turboshaft and APU applications the power turbine (N2)
//  must run at a constant speed regardless of load (helicopter
//  rotor, generator, gearbox).  This controller adjusts the
//  main throttleDemand to hold N2 at targetRpm.
//
//  Architecture:
//    - P-controller, dt-scaled so that gain is independent of
//      main-loop call rate (previous version applied kp*error
//      per tick, making response dependent on CPU load / WiFi
//      processing delays).
//    - Deadband (bandRpm): no correction while inside.
//    - Disengages automatically when N2 is not healthy.
//    - Interacts with ThrottleSlew: governor sets throttleDemand
//      directly; ThrottleSlew then rate-limits it.  Set rampUpMs
//      conservatively so the governor does not fight slew.
//
//  Prop pitch actuator management (turboprop mode):
//    If usePropPitch is true the governor prefers to adjust
//    propPitchDemand first (torque / load change) and only falls
//    back to throttleDemand when pitch reaches its limits.  This
//    matches conventional turboprop governing where the propeller
//    governor is the primary speed-control authority.
//
//    Pitch is slew-rate limited (pitchRampSec: seconds for a
//    full 0→100 % stroke).  The P-gain is also dt-scaled, so
//    the effective rate of change is the lesser of the gain-
//    driven rate and the hard slew cap.
//
//    Internal pitch state (_pitchCurrent) is tracked separately
//    from ed.propPitchDemand so successive adjustments never
//    accumulate floating-point rounding error.
//
//  Config params (set from Config / Hardware::applyConfig()):
//    targetRpm      — desired N2 speed (RPM); 0 = governor disabled
//    bandRpm        — deadband ±RPM (no correction inside this band)
//    kp             — throttle gain: fraction/RPM·s  (e.g. 0.001)
//    pitchKp        — pitch gain:   fraction/RPM·s  (e.g. 0.0005)
//    pitchRampSec   — max pitch travel: full stroke in this many
//                     seconds (0 = unlimited; default 10 s)
