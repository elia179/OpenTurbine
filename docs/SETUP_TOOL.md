# OpenTurbine Setup Tool

The Windows setup tool provides two deliberately distinct paths: **Clean install
/ reinstall** erases a blank or previously used board over USB, while **Update
and keep my setup** updates an existing OpenTurbine board over Wi-Fi without a
factory reset. Users download only:

```text
OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe
```

The repository root [`README.md`](../README.md) is a short gateway; the detailed
user installation and operating guide is [`USER_GUIDE.md`](USER_GUIDE.md).
Focused browser and SmartScreen troubleshooting is
in [`WINDOWS_FLASHER_INSTALL.md`](WINDOWS_FLASHER_INSTALL.md). The rest of this
file is for setup-tool developers and release packagers.

The setup tool installs USB-serial drivers only from complete, unmodified,
vendor-signed INF/CAT/SYS packages bundled in `OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip`.
It does not launch vendor wrapper installers. A small helper process is elevated
through UAC, installs the matching package with Windows `pnputil`, runs a device
rescan, writes diagnostics, and reports the matching COM port back to the GUI.

On launch, the app looks for a local `OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip` next to the
EXE first. If it is not there, it downloads this release asset:

```text
https://github.com/elia179/OpenTurbine/releases/latest/download/OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip
```

Publish `OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip.sha256` beside it so the tool can verify
the download.

## Firmware Support

Current firmware exposes:

```http
GET /api/device_info
```

This endpoint reports the board target (`esp32dev` or `esp32s3dev`), chip name,
firmware version, current state, whether outputs are active, and whether OTA is
currently allowed. The setup tool uses it during Wi-Fi updates when a package
contains both ESP32 and ESP32-S3 firmware.

## Build The Recommended Package

Build both firmware targets and their LittleFS images:

```bash
pio run -e esp32dev
pio run -e esp32dev -t buildfs
pio run -e esp32s3dev
pio run -e esp32s3dev -t buildfs
```

Then create the release ZIP with both extracted driver packages:

```bash
python tools/build_setup_package.py ^
  --esptool C:\path\to\esptool.exe ^
  --cp210x-driver C:\path\to\extracted\CP210x_Windows_Drivers ^
  --ch340-driver C:\path\to\extracted\wch-serial-drivers
```

Pass the extracted vendor folder, not a copied installer EXE. In particular,
the setup tool rejects EXE-only driver folders and any driver folder missing an
`.inf`, `.cat`, or `.sys` payload. WCH CH340/CH341 and CH343/CH910x payloads
belong under `drivers/wch/`; Silicon Labs CP210x payloads belong under
`drivers/cp210x/`.

For local packaging tests only, `--allow-missing-drivers` bypasses the release
requirement. Never publish a package built with that flag.

The script writes:

```text
dist/setup_tool/OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip
dist/setup_tool/OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip.sha256
```

## Release Checklist

Attach these assets to the GitHub release:

```text
OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe
OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe.sha256
OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip
OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip.sha256
```

## Code Signing

Public Windows releases should be Authenticode-signed before publishing. An
unsigned or new low-reputation EXE can trigger Microsoft Defender SmartScreen,
browser download warnings, or Windows 11 Smart App Control. A signature does not
guarantee that Microsoft will immediately stop warning on a brand-new app, but it
gives Windows a verified publisher identity and lets reputation carry forward
across releases signed by the same publisher.

Use a production OV/EV code-signing certificate issued by a CA trusted by
Windows. For local signing from a PFX:

```powershell
$env:WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD = "pfx-password"
.\tools\sign_windows_setup_tool.ps1 `
  -ExePath .\dist\setup_tool\OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe `
  -CertificatePath C:\secure\OpenTurbineCodeSigning.pfx `
  -CertificatePassword $env:WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD
```

For a certificate already installed in the Windows certificate store, or on a
local hardware token exposed through the certificate store:

```powershell
.\tools\sign_windows_setup_tool.ps1 `
  -ExePath .\dist\setup_tool\OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe `
  -CertificateThumbprint "certificate-thumbprint"
```

Generate `OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe.sha256` only after signing:

```powershell
$hash = (Get-FileHash .\dist\setup_tool\OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
"$hash  OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe" | Set-Content -Encoding ascii .\dist\setup_tool\OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe.sha256
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\dist\setup_tool\OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe
```

GitHub Actions can sign the setup tool automatically when these repository
secrets are configured:

```text
WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64   base64-encoded PFX file
WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD PFX password
```

The CI job intentionally skips signing when those secrets are absent, so pull
requests and local forks can still build unsigned test artifacts. Public release
workflows must require signing, verify the Authenticode signature, and generate
the SHA-256 only after signing. If your production certificate uses a cloud HSM,
Azure Trusted Signing, or a USB token that cannot be exported as a PFX, run that
provider's signing step before the checksum step and keep the same publish rule:
sign first, hash second.

The ZIP must contain:

```text
manifest.json
tools/esptool.exe
drivers/cp210x/*.inf
drivers/cp210x/*.cat
drivers/cp210x/**/*.sys
drivers/wch/**/*.inf
drivers/wch/**/*.cat

esp32s3dev/boot_app0.bin
esp32s3dev/firmware.bin
esp32s3dev/littlefs.bin
esp32s3dev/web_assets/*.gz
```

The generated `manifest.json` must include `package_schema: 2` and
`setup_tool_version`, which prevents an EXE/ZIP layout mismatch. Do not publish
a package built with `--allow-missing-drivers`.

Recommended driver sources:

- CP210x: Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers.
- CH340/CH341/CH343: WCH CH341SER Windows USB serial driver.

## Local Tryout

Before publishing a release, place a real `OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip` next to
`OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe` and double-click the EXE. The app will use the local
package first.

Driver installation diagnostics are written under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenTurbine\SetupTool\logs
```

Each attempt writes a `.json` result and a `.txt` log with the setup tool
version, driver kind, INF paths, driver file hashes, pnputil arguments/output,
scan result, reboot-required flag, and matching COM port result. For a remote
test PC, `tools/setup_tool/collect_driver_diagnostics.ps1` can be run manually
to create a read-only diagnostics ZIP from PnPUtil, the serial-port registry,
and the tail of `%WINDIR%\INF\setupapi.dev.log`.

Use a blank or sacrificial board for the first USB install test. For Wi-Fi
updates, the tool backs up `ecu_config.json` into:

```text
Documents\OpenTurbine\Backups
```

Treat backups as private because they can contain the board Wi-Fi password.

[`WINDOWS_USB_DRIVER_ACCEPTANCE.md`](WINDOWS_USB_DRIVER_ACCEPTANCE.md).
